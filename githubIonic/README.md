## About the app:
It is a GitHub user's search.
This app was built with this [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-mobile-app-with-angular-2-and-ionic-2).

Since Ionic 2 provides a starter template we quickly scaffold
a simple app, we start the project with:
> ionic start githubIonic tutorial --v2

To see the app running in different SO you can run the command:
> ionic serve -l

or if you already started the serve, you can do:
> ...//localhost:8100/ionic-lab

To generate new pages, erase the ones in the project and use the commands
> ionic g pages (name)

To get the response from github api, we need to generate a provider:
> ionic g provider github-users

To Build/Run the application you have to add android:
> ionic platform add android
> ionic build android
> ionic run android
